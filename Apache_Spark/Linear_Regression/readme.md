### Linear Regression

We create a supervised learning pipeline, using a subset of the [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). Our goal is to train a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features. This project is run on Databrics Community Edition. Thanks to UC Berkeley Apache Spark Series for the motivation of the work and Databricks to provide us with a community edition.

### We've have done the following:
*  *Part 1:* Read and parse the initial dataset

*  *Part 2:* Create and evaluate a baseline model

*  *Part 3:* Train (via gradient descent) and evaluate a linear regression model

*  *Part 4:* Train using SparkML and tune hyperparameters via grid search

*  *Part 5:* Add interactions between features
